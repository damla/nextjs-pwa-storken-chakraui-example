## About Project

Aim of this project is, trying PWA on a new technology stack.

This project uses the tech stack below:

- NextJS (ReactJS Framework)
- Storken (Global State Management)

What this PWA does is, getting the count and (price coming soon) of objects and calculate the total price for you. Kind of basic invoice calculator.
